Question: 
Figure out why the program stopped running when we used 
Thread.sleep(), and we right clicked/marked the DOS window.

Answer:
I think the problem is Windows-specific. Because I ran the program on my secondary OS (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) and it ran without any problem. The program did NOT stop/pause.
